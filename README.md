Task 1: Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

Description:
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on sepal and petal measurements. Using the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn, it demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training with Logistic Regression, evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix, and prediction on new samples.

Key Outcome:

Achieved around 97% accuracy.

Successfully predicts species for unseen flowers.

Skills gained: data visualization, feature scaling, classification modeling, model evaluation, and prediction.

Task 2: Spam Mail Detector ðŸ“§

Description:
This project builds a classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages using textual data. Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, it demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, removing stopwords), feature extraction using TF-IDF or Bag of Words, model training with Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and F1-score.

Key Outcome:

The model effectively identifies spam messages with high accuracy.

Provides a practical understanding of text preprocessing, NLP feature extraction, and classification modeling.
